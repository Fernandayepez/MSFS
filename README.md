Among S&P 500 constituents as of October 1, 2024, do stocks that outperformed in Q4 2024 tend to continue outperforming in Q1 2025, or do they revert?

I am interested in understanding whether performance in Q4 2024 predicts performance in Q1 2025 ; specifically, estimating P(Q1 Outperformer | Q4 Outperformer) and 
P(Q1 Outperformer | Q4 Underperformer)

To explore this, I classified each stock as either an outperformer or underperformer based on whether its total return exceeded that of the S&P 500 index in each quarter.
Using this classification for both Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, I then constructed contingency tables and ran binary logistic regressions to estimate the relevant conditional 
probabilities.

Key Findings:
Stocks that underperformed in Q4 2024 are much more likely to outperform in Q1 2025.
Stocks that outperformed in Q4 2024 are much more likely to underperform in Q1 2025.

Next Steps:
Dive deeper into the Q4 2024 outperformers to identify potential heterogeneity using quantiles.
